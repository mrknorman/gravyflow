    "# Notebook 00: Installation Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Clone the Repository\n",
    "GravyFlow can be installed by cloning the Git repository:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/mrknorman/gravyflow\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Install Gravyflow\n",
    "It is recommended to install GravyFlow within a new conda environment. GravyFlow requires Python 3.11:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda create --name gravyflow python=3.11\n",
    "conda activate gravyflow\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, ensure pip is installed by running:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda install pip\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, install GravyFlow and its requirements into your conda environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install -e .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that GravyFlow is under active development. Ensure you have a working JAX installation with CUDA support if using GPUs:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install -U \"jax[cuda12_pip]\" -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_cuda_releases.html\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure your environment is configured for JAX/Keras 3:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "export KERAS_BACKEND=jax\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that GravyFlow is optimized for GPU use and relies on vectorized GPU functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Setup permissions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow these guides for setting up permissions to access real data:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://computing.docs.ligo.org/guide/auth/x509/\n",
    "https://computing.docs.ligo.org/guide/auth/kerberos/\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Setup Gravity Spy Permissions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Access Gravity Spy credentials by logging in with your LIGO credentials at:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://secrets.ligo.org/secrets/144/\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, export the obtained username and password:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "export GRAVITYSPY_DATABASE_USER=<user>\n",
    "export GRAVITYSPY_DATABASE_PASSWD=<password>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Test Gravyflow (optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "GravyFlow includes PyTest for testing its functionality. To run tests:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pytest gravyflow\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Tests may fail due to unavailable GPU memory if GPUs are currently under heavy use."
